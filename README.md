# Hare-and-Tortoise
In this project, I am creating a race between Hare and Tortoise. Additionally, this race is held on a slippy mountain. So, I find out who will win this race. The race starts from position 0 to position 69, a total of 70. I am using a library (import java.util.Random) for every step of Tortoise and Hear. If the race is tie then it will consider Tortoise winning this race.
